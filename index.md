## Welcome to LabCore documentation

_LabCore_ is a Web-based suite of tools to serve the needs of agricultural and environmental businesses. Soil Diagnostics, Inc. began the development of LabCore in 2018 with the idea of creating a web-based tool for managing highly specialized business workflows common to the agricultural and environmental sectors. 

Businesses that work with agriculture, livestock, soil & water resources, and forestry typically provide _geospatially-aware_ products and services (e.g. crop scouting, precision agriculture, or pasture management) and need to collaborate in a time-sensitive manner with producers, consultants, and other stakeholders. All such businesses share the following common needs:

1. **Managing Customer data** Businesses organize customer data in a _Client / Farm / Field_ hierarchy, with multiple _Fields_ to a _Farm_ and multiple _Farms_ to a _Client_. 
2. **Managing a Products and Services database** Businesses need to manage a database of products and services, set up service packages, and maintain a pricing structure based on existing relationships.
3. **Creating and fulfiling Work Orders** Efficient revenue generation critically depends upon being able to generate, process and fulfil work orders for clients.
4. **Upload and visualize geospatial data** Modern farming operations rely heavily on remote-sensing or machine-generated geospatial data to derive insights on productivity and RoI. 
5. **Capture Client- and Field-specific management data** Being able to easily document the location and timing of farming operations, disease management, infrastructure improvements and incidental damage reports are necessary for accountability in management
6. **Assurances for data privacy** Businesses must be able to assure privacy for their clients' data using industry best practices, while still enabling access and collaboration with third-party service providers.

_LabCore_ provides a set of tools and an extensible, flexible and well-tested working solution to address all the common needs above. The goal of LabCore is to enables creative and modern agribusinesses to innovate in their services, without having to spend the time and resources to reinvent the technological foundation.
